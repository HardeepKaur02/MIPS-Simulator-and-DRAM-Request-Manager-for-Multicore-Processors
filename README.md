# MIPS Simulator and DRAM Request Manager for Multicore Processors
- An interpreter for a subset of the MIPS ISA, maintaining internal data structures to represent processor components like Register File,Memory and ALU
- Simulates DRAM access timings,enabling Non-Blocking Memory Access, Memory Request Ordering and Data forwarding to increase throughput efficiency
- Simulates Memory Request Manager to efficiently handle DRAM requests from different cores in Multicore Processors
